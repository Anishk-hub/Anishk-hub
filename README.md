Q1. By default, Django signals are executed synchronously. This means that when a signal is sent, all the connected signal handlers are executed in the same thread and process, and the execution of the sender’s code will not proceed until all signal handlers have finished.

           # models.py
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
import time

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal handler started")
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulating long processing
    print("Signal handler finished")

# Usage
instance = MyModel(name="test")
instance.save()
print("Instance saved")

Explanation:

When instance.save() is called, it triggers the post_save signal.
The my_handler function, which is connected to this signal, will be executed synchronously.
The print("Instance saved") line will only be executed after my_handler has completed its execution.

Q2. Yes, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller. The signal handlers are executed in the thread that initiates the signal.

# models.py
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
import threading

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal handler in thread:", threading.current_thread().name)

# Usage
instance = MyModel(name="test")
instance.save()

Explanation:

The print("Signal handler in thread:", threading.current_thread().name) statement will show the name of the thread in which the signal handler is running.
When you save the instance, the signal handler runs in the same thread as the caller, which is the main thread in this case.


Q3. By default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller. If a signal handler performs actions that affect the database, these actions will be part of the same transaction.

# models.py
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.db import transaction

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    with transaction.atomic():
        # Do some database operations
        pass

# Usage
instance = MyModel(name="test")
instance.save()

Explanation:

The transaction.atomic() block ensures that the signal handler’s database operations are part of the same transaction.
If the transaction is rolled back, all operations including those performed in the signal handler will also be rolled back.


Rectangle class:

class Rectangle:
    def _init_(self, length: int, width: int):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
    
    def _iter_(self):
        yield {'length': self.length}
        yield {'width': self.width}

# Example usage:
rect = Rectangle(10, 5)
for item in rect:
    print(item)

Explanation:

The Rectangle class initializes with length and width.
The _iter_ method makes the class iterable, yielding dictionaries with length and width values in sequence.
